🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their shopping behavior. It is built using Streamlit to provide an interactive web application that allows users to upload their own data, perform analysis, visualize clusters, and download the results.

🚀 Features
✅ Upload your own customer data (CSV) or use the default Mall_Customers.csv
✅ Automatic Data Cleaning: Missing values and duplicates check
✅ Interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with graphs and heatmaps
✅ Select features dynamically for K-Means Clustering
✅ Visualize customer segments in 2D and 3D scatter plots
✅ Silhouette Score to evaluate clustering quality
✅ Download the clustered data as CSV
✅ Simple explanations for better understanding

📊 How to Use
Upload a customer dataset (or use the built-in one).

Explore data quality, visualizations, and patterns.

Select clustering features (e.g., Income, Age, Spending Score).

Choose the number of clusters using the slider.

Visualize the clusters in 2D/3D plots.

Download the clustered dataset for business insights.

📄 Sample Dataset (Optional)
If no file is uploaded, the app uses the built-in Mall_Customers.csv dataset.

Feature	Description
CustomerID	Unique customer ID
Gender	Male/Female
Age	Customer age
Annual Income (k$)	Customer income in $1000s
Spending Score (1-100)	Score assigned based on shopping habits

💡 Use Cases
Customer segmentation for targeted marketing

Loyalty program design

Customer behavior analysis

Business strategy and planning

📌 Future Enhancements (Optional)
Add more clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)

Save cluster models for future use
